# Hi, I'm Jooho Hwang

Iâ€™m an embedded systems engineer driven by a genuine passion for creating reliable and efficient solutions.

Building on my experience in **digital circuit design using Verilog** and **system programming with C/C++** for both **MCUs and Linux-based platforms**, I have developed a strong foundation across hardware and software aspects of embedded systems.

I place great importance on **system reliability in mission-critical environments**, aiming to design **stable, error-free systems** that perform consistently under demanding conditions.

My goal is to continue growing as a developer who contributes to a **safer and better society through technology**.
